## Overview

This Streamlit-based app integrates various machine learning models to perform multitasking in image, text, and data analysis. It covers tasks like tumor detection, text classification, sentiment analysis, and iris species prediction. Each task employs specific pre-trained models, offering a user-friendly interface for predictive analysis across different domains.

### Tumor Classification
- **Model**: CNN-based architecture
- **Functionality**: Detects the presence of a tumor in uploaded images.
- **How It Works**: Utilizes convolutional layers to analyze image patterns for tumor identification.

### SMS Spam Detection
- **Model**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network
- **Functionality**: Classifies text messages as 'Spam' or 'Not spam.'
- **How It Works**: Processes text sequences to detect spam patterns and make predictions.

### IMDb Sentiment Analysis
- **Model**: LSTM-based architecture
- **Functionality**: Analyzes sentiment polarity of movie reviews.
- **How It Works**: Learns from sequential text data to determine sentiment as 'Positive' or 'Negative.'

### Iris Flower Classification-DNN
- **Model**: Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- **Functionality**: Predicts iris species based on provided parameters.
- **How It Works**: Utilizes multiple layers to learn and predict iris species.

### Digit Recognition
- **Model**: CNN architecture
- **Functionality**: Recognizes digits from uploaded images (0-9).
- **How It Works**: Processes images through convolutional layers for digit classification.

### Iris Species Prediction-Perceptron
- **Model**: Perceptron model
- **Functionality**: Predicts iris species using a Perceptron algorithm.
- **How It Works**: Makes predictions based on linear combinations of input features.

### Iris Species Prediction-Backpropagation
- **Model**: Backpropagation-based model
- **Functionality**: Predicts iris species using Backpropagation technique.
- **How It Works**: Utilizes backpropagation algorithm to adjust model parameters for predictions.
